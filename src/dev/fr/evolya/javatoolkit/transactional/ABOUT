	" In many applications that use Tracking Library, a large number of
	disparate tasks happen simultaneously. Incoming data arrives from
	multiple sources, entities are filtered into groups depending on
	different criteria, entities are visualized, and reports, charts,
	and graphs are generated continually. To take advantage of modern
	multi-core hardware, we would like for many of these tasks to happen
	in separate threads. This presents a challenge, though: how do we
	manage access to the entity data from multiple threads, each doing
	potentially unrelated work, in a way that is fast and resistant to
	data races and deadlocks? "
